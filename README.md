# DungeonOfDanger-Yab
Haiku Yab version of Dungeon of Danger by Howard Berenbon

WHAT IT IS: A sort of adventure, sort of RPG (but not quite). It's all text. I guess you could consider it a sort of evolution of games like "Hunt the Wumpus." It was originally published in a book where the book buyer could type it in and run it and have a game. It was also originally written in BASIC, because just about every computer back then had a flavor of BASIC. This particular version is for Yab, a variant of Yabasic for the Haiku operating system.

WHY IS IT: Short version is I told someone he should learn to program the way I did: by typing in BASIC programs from books and magazines. Then I started to think, "Hey, I haven't done that in a long time. I wonder if it's any fun  now?" So, after converting this to Python, I figured a Haiku version with a rudimentary GUI would be neat.

NOTES: This is about as 'pure' as I can get. Yab doesn't have line numbers, but you can use numbers as labels to use with GOTO and GOSUB. So that's what I did. I only used SUBs for the graphical bits (and I'm stretching the term 'graphical'). 

HOW TO PLAY:
	For whatever reason,  you find yourself on the second level of a two level dungeon. The goal is to work  your way up and out of the dungeon. You do this by finding 'enchanted' keys and walking up a staircase. Along the way there will be monsters to fight and other encounters. Some are good, most are bad. You have a set amount of turns to accomplish this. Even after typing in the program, I have no idea how many turns that is. I've not run out of turns playing yet, so it's probably fairly high.
	Move around the dungeon by typing in the first letter of the direction you want to go in (like, N for north, U for up, etc.). It's not too difficult. When you find a map, it will be displayed in the window so you don't have to type 'M' to see it. Likewise, you don't have to remember how many hit points you have or if you found a key, as those will show up in the window, too. Those were the only deviations from the original program that I made.
	So, there you go. Have fun with it.
